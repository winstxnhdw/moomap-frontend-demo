# moomapp-frontend

A single-page web application to showcase the possibilities of a robust route optimiser built on Vue and Leaflet.js for MooVita. This is also my very first web app/site.

> I do not have the permission to reveal the actual application I developed for MooVita. This is only a showcase demo I built to familiarise myself with the Vue framework.
